# Mem_SVA_LTB_Dynamic
Golden file Based SVA Layered Testbench with Coverage Analysis of a Memory Unit. 

A Dynamic Golden File approach.
There are no constraints applied to suppress the memory input signals in this approach. 
For every write  operation,  the  memory  is  updated  with  the  data  to  be written in a specific address location. 
In the very same packet of  transaction,  the  golden  file  is  also  updated  with  the  data value and itâ€™s corresponding address location
